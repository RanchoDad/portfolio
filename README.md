# portfolio
For my portfolio, I began with a skeleton of div's to outline each piece that I would later style and to which I added javascript. This included classes and id's for items throughout. 

HTML

Head

-linked google font and bootstrap css


Body

-the navbar is built with internal and external links for both mobile and desktop view

-Each section can be navigated to from the navbar and is outlined in the main section

-Buttons in the navbar allow the user to switch between light and dark

Resume

-I added modals as an easy way to view basic information about my work experience followed by a link to my full resume


Projects

-I don't really have projects besides this page?
-I've redone the word matching game a little bit. I added a feature to add your own choices to the array and then click a button until there's only 1 choice left. When I first did it, it was because someone in class suggested 'cohort survivor' when we were left alone in the zoom room...


CSS

-the stylesheet is organized from top to bottom in the html with the media query for smaller screens at the end

-the navbar is fixed to the top for easy site navigation

-and for ease, there is a 'scroll to top' button at the bottom of the screen

-the overlays, close buttons and modals contain a lot of details as they require more attention to activate correctly with the javascript

-I want to redo some of the styling of the modals too

-the media query changes the navbar layout, removing the sections and leaving the outside links

-the footer still needs some styling to get the contact links to lay horizontally

-At first I thought the modal was super hard, but styling in css is so tough. I feel like I went back and forth in divs and classes and containers so much trying to get things to fit a certain way. 


JS
 
-the first section has the variables, functions and elements to create and execute a 'scroll to top' button

-the second section has the variables, functions and elements to create and execute 2 modals, their overlays, and 2 ways to exit each modal

-the third section is setup for 2 buttons, one for dark and one for light mode
