# portfolio
For my portfolio, I began with a skeleton of div's to outline each piece that I would later style and to which I added javascript. This included classes and id's for items throughout. 

HTML
Head
-linked google font and bootstrap css

Body
-the navbar is built with internal and external links for both mobile and desktop view
-Each section can be navigated to from the navbar and is outlined in the main section

Resume
-I added modals as an easy way to view basic information about my work experience followed by a link to my full resume

Projects
-

CSS
-the stylesheet is organized from top to bottom in the html with the media query for smaller screens at the end
-the navbar is fixed to the top for easy site navigation
-and for ease, there is a 'scroll to top' button at the bottom of the screen
-the overlays, close buttons and modals contain a lot of details as they require more attention to activate correctly with the javascript
-the media query changes the navbar layout, removing the sections and leaving the outside links

JS
-the first section has the variables, functions elements to create and execute a 'scroll to top' button
-the second section has the variables, functions elements to create and execute 2 modals, their overlays, and 2 ways to exit each modal
